# Neomanav Robotics 

🚀 **Building Humanoids**  

Welcome to the official GitHub organisation for **Neomanav Robotics**.  
We are a deep-tech initiative from India with a bold vision: **to design and build a humanoid robot that combines intelligence, agility, and human-like interaction.**  

## 🌏 About Us  
Neomanav Robotics is on a mission to push the boundaries of robotics and artificial intelligence from India to the world. Our humanoid project is focused on:  
- 🤖 **Engineering** – Advanced mechatronics, control systems, and hardware innovation.  
- 🧠 **Intelligence** – AI-driven perception, decision-making, and natural interaction.  
- 🏗️ **Design** – Human-inspired form factor optimised for mobility, dexterity, and safety.  
- 🌱 **Impact** – Building technology that contributes to research, education, and real-world applications.  

## 📂 What You’ll Find Here  
This organization hosts repositories that cover the entire stack of humanoid development, including:  
- **Hardware CAD & Electronics** – Designs, schematics, and mechanical systems.  
- **Control Software** – Low-level motion control, balance, and locomotion.  
- **Perception & AI** – Computer vision, speech, and natural interaction models.  
- **Simulation & Tools** – Gazebo, ROS-based frameworks, and testing environments.
